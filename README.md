# Dotfiles

My personal Linux dotfiles and config files.

## Setup on fresh install

- Link config files: Run the `create_symlinks.py` script to create symbolic links from the files/directories in the `$HOME` directory to the files/directories in this repository.

## Random Notes

- If tmux is bugging out and saying 'tmux-256color' : unknown terminal, install the `ncurses-terminal` package
- To get neovim to recognize the .vimrc, type :nvim-from-vim in a neovim instance and follow the instructions
